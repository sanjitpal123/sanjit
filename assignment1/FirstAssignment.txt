2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTMl document.
   
   solution:

   Comments in HTML serve as non-rendered text that provides information about the code for human readers.
   They are useful for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts
   of the code without deleting them. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the rendering of the
    webpage.


    Example:
         

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
         <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
             <title>First Web</title>
        </head>

    structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
    content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
    element enclosed within the tags.

    Answer:
       
       The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction placed at the beginning of an HTML document to
       specify the version of HTML being used. It ensures proper rendering and parsing by web browsers. The most
       common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
